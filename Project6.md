
This project analyses and evaluates finite difference methods for the Dirac equation and the variational MCDHF method as described in the report “Analysis of Numerical Methods for the Dirac Equation”. 

## Test the various algorithms in Matlab

Of particular interest are methods that approximate the differentiation operator that lead to a set of linear equatoins.   By contract, GRASP integrates each each equation and approximates the integration operator.
